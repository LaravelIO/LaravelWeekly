# Laravel Weekly #19

Hey guys and girls, welcome to Laravel Weekly #19. It's a small one because last week's issue was released pretty late. We have some more Laracon EU news and another raffle. Definitely also check into [Chris](http://fideloper.com/)' new blog post series, I'm pretty excited about that. Chris has written some great posts in the past and I expect these new blog posts to build further on top of that.

See ya next week!

## News

### New Laravel.io Podcast

In case you missed it, there's a new Laravel.io Podcast episode. In this episode [Shawn McCool](https://twitter.com/ShawnMcCool), [Taylor Otwell](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell) and [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) discuss Laracon, architecture, testing and more.

### Laracon EU Early Video Access

You can now purchase special tickets to get early access to the conference's videos when they're done. So if you can't attend the conference this is a nice way to get in early on all the talks which were given at Laracon EU.

### Wanted: Coding Problems!

[Chris Fidao](http://fideloper.com/) is currently looking for common coding problems you're having in Laravel to write up a new blog post series. Since Chris definitely isn't just any Laravel developer, you can expect some high quality posts from him.
