# Laravel Weekly #10

Welcome to the 10th edition of Laravel Weekly. I'm very happy to say that the series will be posted here, on Laravel.io, from now on. I'd like to thank Shawn and everyone else at Laravel.io for giving Laravel Weekly a new home.

The posts have been given a few new features. Besides a new home, I'll also be doing interviews with community members from now on. I'll try to post an interview every 2 editions of Laravel Weekly. The first one is with [Niall O'Brien](http://laravel.io/topic/26/an-interview-with-niall-obrien), someone who has been involved with the Laravel community for quite a while now and is a well respected community member.

I'll also be highlighting some resources in the news section, keeping a calendar for upcoming events (please send in your meetups, talks, etc) and also post general PHP related resources from now on. All in together, a little more content for you to enjoy each week.

Again, I'd like to thank all of you for reading and for the great feedback you all have been giving. If you'd like to see your package, blog post, anything related to Laravel at all in this weekly blog post, contact me.

Onwards to next week for issue #11!
