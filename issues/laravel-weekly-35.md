# Laravel Weekly #35

Here's the last issue for 2013. I wish each and everyone of you a happy new year. May 2014 be as great for you as 2013 was for me.

I started with Laravel Weekly as a series of blog posts when I was first learning on how to use Laravel. I couldn't have imagined it becoming such a big thing. Just last week, Laravel Weekly had its 900th subscriber signed up. A dazzling number. I can't thank you all enough for all the support you've given this project.

I have some plans for Laravel Weekly in 2014 and some more projects to come and can't wait to share them with you.

Thanks for reading and see ya next year!

PS. Don't forget Laravel Weekly has a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/LaravelWeekly) which I also use to send out the latest issues. I also love feedback so don't be shy on sending a mention now and then :-)
