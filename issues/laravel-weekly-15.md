# Laravel Weekly #15

Hey there, welcome to Laravel Weekly issue #15!

Wow, has it already been 15 issues? Time flies! It's been about 3,5 months ago [since I first started posting](http://driesvints.com/blog/weekly-laravel-4-learnings-week-1/) these series. I'm really happy about how Laravel Weekly has evolved so far.

But there's always room for improvement. I've got some more plans in mind for LW, including a possible newsletter. Before we get started on that, I'd first like to know what all of you think about LW so far. I've created a little 6-question survey so you can tell what you'd like to see added or changed to LW. It'll only take a few minutes of your time.

[Please help us by filling in this 6-question survey](http://laravelweekly.typeform.com/to/Ckj2L5)

Thank you so much! :)

See you next week!

## News

### Laravel Packages Registry

[Maxime Fabre](https://twitter.com/anahkiasen) has created a website which lists all of the Laravel packages on [https://packagist.org](packagist.org). 

On a side-note: apparently there are already 300+ packages developed for Laravel 4. Great work community!

### Laravel Essentials Reloaded

[Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) recently left [Nettuts](http://net.tutsplus.com/) to focus entirely on [Tutsplus Premium](https://tutsplus.com). One of the things he's planning is a refreshed course of Laravel 4 Essentials tutorials.

### New php.net Website

Not really Laravel related but relevant for PHP. You might or might not have noticed it but [php.net](http://php.net/) recently updated its website with a theme that had been in the pipeline for quite some time.
