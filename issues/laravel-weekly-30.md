# Laravel Weekly #30

Small update this week. Seems like more and more details about the next Laracon are slowly being revealed. Looks like the conference will be much larger then last year with more speakers. 2-track conference perhaps? Who knows...

What I do know is that we could use some help for the Laravel Weeklies! We used to do quick tips but unfortunately we haven't had much time to dig up new quick tips for Laravel Weekly. If any of you want to help out and send in a quick tip for any of the next issues then send them to hello@laravelweekly.com. Please send along a [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) with the Quick-Tip! We'll of course feature your name and link to a page of your choice (personal website, twitter account,...).

See ya next week!

### What's new and upcoming in Laravel 4.1

[Mark Van Eijk](http://markvaneijk.com/) has put [a wonderful post](http://markvaneijk.com/whats-new-and-upcoming-in-laravel-4-1) together about some of the new features in the upcoming Laravel 4.1 release.

### Laracon Is Coming

Seems that more and more details about the next Laracon US are getting revealed. We've found some interesting concept designs on Dribbble...

And... [a concept for the new website](http://dribbble.com/shots/1317294-Laracon-Site?list=users). Judging from the concept there will be early bird tickets as well as VIP tickets. And if the text in the description is correct we can expect a much larger conference than last time with more speakers and two full conference days. We can't wait to see what the rest of the conference holds!
