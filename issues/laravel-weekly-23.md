# Laravel Weekly #23

We're back after taking a week off after Laracon EU. It was so much fun to finally meet so many people in real life. Thanks to everyone who came out! I can't wait until next year.

A lot has happened in the past 2 weeks after Laracon EU. Chris' book, Implementing Laravel came out today, Laracasts is moving closer to its release and people have again been posting awesome articles and other resources.

I also can't believe this newsletter is already at 406 subscribers. That's insane! Thank you all so much.

I hope you enjoy this week's overview. See you next week!

### Laracon EU Recap

It's been 2 weeks now since Laracon EU and we had a blast! Thank you so much to all the speakers, sponsors, attendees, people of Bimhuis, all the volunteers and everyone else I'm forgetting for making it such a great event. Especially thanks to Jeroen and Shawn for all the hard work they put into this. Everything went smoothly. The speakers were great, the food was delicious and the view from the Bimhuis was amazing. We hope you had a great time because we can't wait to welcome you all back next year!

People who subscribed for early video access should have received the links to the raw videos and slides by now. If you haven't, make sure to send an email to [contact@laracon.eu](mailto:contact@laracon.eu) so we can sort things out. Everyone will get access to the produced videos once they're finished.

In the meantime the Laravel community has been rather busy taking pictures, making blog posts and commenting on Twitter about Laracon EU. We decided give you an overview.

We also had lots of fun Saturday night on the #laravel channel on IRC. Here's a very active Laravel community member in disguise [trolling his fellow developers](http://d.pr/i/x68C) ;-)

### Implementing Laravel Released

[Chris](https://twitter.com/fideloper)' book, [Implementing Laravel has been released](https://leanpub.com/implementinglaravel). In his book, Chris will provide details on code organisation, using Laravel's IoC container and Service Providers and creating testable and maintainable code.

### From Apprentice To Artisan: New Chapter

Taylor Otwell recently added a new chapter to his book, [Laravel: From Apprentice To Artisan](https://leanpub.com/laravel). In this new chapter he goes over decoupling handlers. It's the first of several new chapters to come.

### Laravel 4 ACL

[Christopher Pitt](https://twitter.com/followchrisp), who posted an in-depth tutorial about [authentication in Laravel 4](https://medium.com/on-coding/e8d93c9ce0e2) a few weeks ago, has posted a follow-up tutorial about [managing user groups](https://medium.com/on-coding/a7f2fa1f9791). Again very in-depth, with lots of tips and tricks for various use-cases.

### Laracasts Forum

In preparation for the big launch, [Laracasts](http://laracasts.com/) has launched [a forum for its website](http://laracasts.com/forum/) where people can discuss the posted screencasts and other PHP and Laravel related topics.

### Laravel Schema Designer

This is pretty cool. [Thomas](https://twitter.com/Okyn01) made [a Laravel schema designer for Laravel 4](http://www.laravelsd.com/). You can basically boilerplate your entire database and export the migrations. Very handy!

## Quick Tip

Did you know that as of a couple of weeks ago you can use the Formbuilder class to pre-populate select fields with numeric ranges, years or months? [Take a closer look here at how it's done.](https://gist.github.com/driesvints/6543470#file-laravel-weekly-23-quick-tip-php)
