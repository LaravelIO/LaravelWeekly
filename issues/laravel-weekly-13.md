# Laravel Weekly #13

Here's a new small Laravel Weekly update.

[Laracon.eu](http://laracon.eu/2013) is a little over 2 months away as more details are getting released. There's still plenty of time left to buy your tickets but don't wait until the last possible second!

Much packages have been released this week. It seems that development with Laravel 4 is really picking up its pace. If you want yours to be included here, make sure to let me know.

I'll be back next week with more news from Laraland!
