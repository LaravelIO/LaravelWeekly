### New Laravel IO Website

[The new Laravel IO website](http://laravel.io/) is finally launched! Thanks to all the beta testers for helping out! For now, only the new forums are launched. The articles will be back very soon. The old forums will stay online but will be read-only as of the 7th of February. [A brand new pastebin](http://laravel.io/bin) was also released.

[Check out this post](http://laravel-news.com/post/74778201800/what-is-coming-to-laravel-io) by [Laravel News](https://twitter.com/laravelnews) for a great overview on everything that's new.


### Final Call for Speakers for Laracon!

Laracon is entering its [final Call for Speakers](https://twitter.com/laravelphp/status/428919253853413377) for Laracon. Make sure to send in your talk proposals because time is running out!

Speaking of Laracon, I've heard that [42% of the tickets are already sold](https://twitter.com/ianlandsman/status/428709847044222977). And the real conference website and full line-up of speakers hasn't even been put up yet. Crazy!

### Vote for Laravel at the NET Awards!

It's that time of the year again folks. While last year we had big competition from other Open-Source projects like Bootstrap this year we have a chance to win! Laravel has really grown in the past year and we can show that by voting for it as the Open-Source project of the year. We'll still have to handle tough competition from other projects like Grunt, Bower, Angular and others but we stand a fair chance. [Go vote for Laravel here!](https://thenetawards.com/vote/open-source/)

Also, you may want to vote for [Bootsnipp](http://bootsnipp.com/) as [Side Project of the year](https://thenetawards.com/vote/side-project). It's built by prominent community members [Maksim Surguy](https://twitter.com/msurguy) and is built on Laravel.

### Laravel User Group Munich

There's a new Laravel user group for developers living in Munich or nearby cities. They're planning their first meetup tbh. soon. Check out [their Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/laravel-munich/) for more info.

### Elivio

Elivio is a widget and SaaS that attempts to allow site owners to provide ‘contextual support’ to their users, and provide insights on user behaviour. By simply adding in a javascript snippet, they can manage the tips from an admin panel. When a user is using their website, they can click on certain items to get more information about that item to help them move forward. The idea is that the user can keep moving, rather than have to leave to an FAQ or support system to try and find a solution.

Check out their [website](http://www.elev.io/)!
