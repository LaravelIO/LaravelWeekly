## News

### Laracon EU is next week!

It's almost hard to believe but [Laracon EU](http://laracon.eu/2013/) is just a week away from now! In one week we'll be joining over 200 Laravel developers in Amsterdam to listen to some great talks from some of the most talented people in our industry. Exciting times!

There's still time to get your tickets if you haven't! If you're still having a hard time on deciding for a ticket then maybe this will help. [Cartalyst](http://www.cartalyst.com/) just announced that the final 30 tickets for Laracon EU will also get 60% of [a quarterly subscription](http://www.cartalyst.com/pricing) for Cartalyst. That's some premium components you're getting for your Laravel projects for a very low amount of money.

And if that's not enough, Laravel itself recently announced that everyone at Laracon EU will get a free copy of [Taylor's recent book](https://twitter.com/laravelphp/status/367498147884318720), "From Apprentice to Artisan".

### Podcast #3 - Packages!

For those of you that missed it. Last week [laravel.io](http://laravel.io/) published its [third Laravel podcast](http://laravel.io/topic/44/podcast-3-packages) . In this episode, Laravel author [Taylor Otwell](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell) discusses packages with his teammate / backbone-ninja [Eric Barnes](https://twitter.com/ericlbarnes) and Laravel community contributor, [Ryan Tablada](https://twitter.com/RyanTablada).

### Laravel 4 Authentication

[Christopher Pitt](https://twitter.com/followchrisp) wrote a very in-depth tutorial about [authentication in Laravel 4](https://medium.com/on-coding/e8d93c9ce0e2). In his tutorial he'll help you set up an application which handles user authentication and everything that goes along with it like password resetting and error handling. A great tutorial for beginning Laravel 4 developers.

### Implementing Laravel

[Chris Fidao](https://twitter.com/fideloper), a prominent Laravel community member, is currently working on [a new Laravel book](https://leanpub.com/implementinglaravel) about how to implement Laravel in a real world application. I'm very much looking forward to this one!

### Cartalyst launches team accounts

[Cartalyst](http://www.cartalyst.com/), the company that offers premium Laravel 4 packages and applications, now also offers [team accounts](http://blog.cartalyst.com/post/58245326721/team-accounts-pricing) .

## Quick Tip

Did you know you could use the "implode" method to paste values of a Collection class instance together? Or that you could use the "take" method to grab the first or last x amount of items? Check out some examples [here](http://paste.laravel.com/Li1).
