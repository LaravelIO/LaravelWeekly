# Laravel Weekly #36

Happy new year everyone! Here's the first issue of 2014.

First of all I'd like to say a big thank you to Laracasts for mentioning us in [its recent community screencast](https://laracasts.com/lessons/laravel-community-crash-course)! Thanks to them many new readers found their way to Laravel Weekly. While we were excited to announce that we reached 900 subscribers last year we can now let you know that we've grown to more than 1200 subscribers! Insanity!

The first Laracon speakers were announced over the past few days. The conference is starting to look really exciting. We hope many of you can make it! Definitely check out the Laracon give-away by Snappy below in the news to win a free ticket.

See you next week!

### Groupiful

[Groupiful](https://groupiful.com/) is a brand new SaaS that provides an easy way for groups to manage communication, tasks, notes, files and more.
