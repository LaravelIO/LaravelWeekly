### EllisLab Seeking New Owner for CodeIgniter

Something a lot of people have been anticipating has happened. [ElissLab](http://ellislab.com/), the company behind the CodeIgniter framework, is actively seeking a new maintainer for the framework. Because of their priorities they couldn't give CodeIgniter the amount of time it deserved. CodeIgniter had to compete with newer and more modern frameworks like Laravel over the past year(s), struggling to keep up.
