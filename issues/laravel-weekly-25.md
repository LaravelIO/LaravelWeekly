# Laravel Weekly #25

[Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) has finally been released. The community has been begging for some sort of Laravel knowledge hub for a few months now that L4 is out. Laracasts perfectly answers this demand as it provides you with educational screencasts on various subjects ranging from architecture, repositories, testing, deployment and so on. If you want Jeffrey to add more screencasts on a subject you'd like to see covered, [try requesting it in the forums](http://laracasts.com/forum/).

Laravel 4.1 is getting closer as well with more features being added to the Artisan command since last week. Can't wait for it to get released so we can start using the new remote component and the live debugger.

Anyway, thanks for reading and see you all next week!

## News

### Native Artisan Support in PhpStorm

JetBrains recently released an update for PhpStorm to include native Laravel Artisan support. [Read all about it in their blog post](http://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2013/09/command-line-tools-based-on-symfony-console-doctrine-laravel-in-phpstorm/).

### New Laravel 4.1 Artisan Features

Laravel 4.1 is coming closer to its release date and with it a bunch of new features have been added. With 4.1 [Boris REPL is integrated](https://twitter.com/laravelphp/status/380883629292806144) into the "tinker" Artisan command.

A new "debug" Artisan command has been added for live debugging. Taylor featured this in his Laracon EU talk.

Also, a new "env" Artisan command has been added to quickly check on which environment your app is running. This one has been back-ported to 4.0.

And if that wasn't enough, Taylor just released a new "view:publish" command so package builders can publish their views to the application.

## Quick Tip

Did you know that the Filebuilder class in Laravel has some pretty powerful file handlers besides the standard file functions? [Take a closer look here.](https://gist.github.com/driesvints/6784886)
