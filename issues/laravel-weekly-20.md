# Laravel Weekly #20

This week we have some exciting news for Laracon EU this week. Jordi Boggiano, one of the lead developers of Composer is coming over. I'm excited to hear from him about Composer and perhaps what the future holds for tool.

We're also getting close to the Laravel Weekly newsletter. If all goes well, the first issue should arrive in your inboxes next week. In the meanwhile you can [sign-up here](http://eepurl.com/DGabL).

I hope you enjoy this week's resources!

## News

### Seldaek is coming to Laracon EU

[Laracon EU](http://laracon.eu/2013/) has announced that Rafael Dohmns can't make it. We're going to miss his presentation and wish him all the best! Laracon EU immediately made work of finding a proper replacement and they sure did.  
Jordi Boggiano, also known as [@seldaek](https://twitter.com/seldaek) on twitter and one of the lead developers of [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/) is coming to Laracon EU to give an in-depth talk about Composer.

### Laravel Weekly Newsletter Update

You can now start subscribing for the Laravel Weekly newsletter. We're aiming at sending out the first newsletter next week. The first newsletter will be a bit of a trial to see what you all think of the design and content format. You can post your opinions here on [laravel.io](http://laravel.io) and we'll try to improve the newsletter from there.

You can sign-up for the newsletter [here](http://eepurl.com/DGabL).

### The Laravel Foundations Project

We recently announced *[The Laravel Foundations Project](http://laravel.io/topic/43/the-laravel-foundations-project)*, a project that seeks experienced developers to write articles about the common questions that beginner Laravel Developers struggle with. 

### Laracasts

It seems that [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) is working on a side project for the new [laracasts.com](http://laracasts.com) website. While it's still very mysterious and all, it's probably safe to say that we're going to get a whole new series of high quality Laravel screencasts very soon. You can already check out a preview screencast [here](http://social-sharing.s3.amazonaws.com/11-Refactoring-For-PSR-0.mp4). 

Follow the twitter account [@laracasts](https://twitter.com/laracasts) and subscribe on [laracasts.com](http://laracasts.com) to stay up to date when they're launching their first screencasts.

### Ryan Tablada

If you want a good source for Laravel tutorials then [Ryan's blog](http://ryantablada.com/) is the place to be. He's been writing tutorials and articles like crazy resulting in a massive list or resources for you to spend some learning time on.

## Quick Tip

> Composer tip: even though they don't list it, composer dump may be used instead of composer dump-autoload.
