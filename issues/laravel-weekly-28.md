# Laravel Weekly #28

We're back after a small break. Doing a weekly newsletter can sometimes be tedious and time-consuming but we're glad to bring you issue #28! We've passed the 600 readers milestone a couple of days ago which is insane! Thanks again so much for all of your support.

It's November so Laravel 4.1 is nearing its completion. [Taylor has been teasing](https://twitter.com/laravelphp/status/391766638053191680) some [new changes](https://twitter.com/laravelphp/status/391057678098632704) these past few weeks and we're excited to see what the final features are going to be.

As always, thanks for reading!
