# Laravel Weekly #11

Hey, welcome to another issue of Laravel Weekly. Laravel 4 is just a week old now and there have already been an insane amount of resources posted. I'll try to get you up to date on everything.

First of all, the Laravel IRC channel has moved to [laravel.io](http://laravel.io) and can now be found under [laravel.io/irc](http://laravel.io/irc). Come join us on IRC if you have some questions regarding Laravel or just want to chat with some fellow Laravel developers!

[The .net award winners have been announced](http://www.thenetawards.com/) and sadly Laravel wasn't chosen as the winner in "Open Source project of the year". But hey, with competitors like [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) it's not a shame that we lost. We'll show them next year!

Also, people [have been receiving](https://twitter.com/jonathanmarvens/status/341195091270041600) their [Laravel 4 shirts](https://twitter.com/imjakechapman/status/341658953631010816). Did you get yours already? Let us know in the comments below! If you missed out on the last batch there's a second one in the run [here](http://teespring.com/laravel-redux).

Thanks for reading and see you all next week!

### Easier Laravel 4 Installation

*A quick tip by [Laravel](https://twitter.com/laravelphp)*

Composer has a neat little feature which allows you to install a composer package from [packagist](https://packagist.org/) and immidiatly run a composer install command all in a simultaneous task. Installing Laravel 4 doesn't gets easier then this:

	composer create-project laravel/laravel
