## News

### Laracon EU starts tomorrow!

Laracon EU kicks off this friday. It's going to be 2 great days full of Laravel awesomeness!

If you're staying in Amsterdam for the conference then we suggest that you have a look at [the spotted by locals website](http://www.spottedbylocals.com/amsterdam/). Spotted by locals offers a great guide so you can experience the city like if you were living here!

If you're coming over for the conference make sure you get here on time before the talks begin. There's nothing worse then disturbing a speaker during his talk by sneaking in! You can register starting from 1PM up till 2PM when the first talk begins on thursday.

The event pages at [lanyrd.com](http://lanyrd.com/2013/laraconeu/) and [joind.in](https://joind.in/event/view/1480) got updated for the event so please subscribe to them if you're coming to Laracon EU. Also, please rate the talks for the speakers during or after the conference on [joind.in](https://joind.in/event/view/1480). Giving speaker feedback is super important as it'll help them improve their skills at speaking at conferences.

If you're taking pictures at Laracon EU we'd love to know! Send all your Laracon EU pictures to [@LaravelWeekly](https://twitter.com/LaravelWeekly) on twitter or email us at hello [at] laravelweekly [dot] com and we'll have some sort of a photo album up after the event.

We're very excited to meet a lot of you in person. Let's make this a wonderful conference!

### Podcast #4 - Laracon, Lean and War Stories

Last week the latest [laravel.io](http://laravel.io/) podcast was published. In [podcast #4](http://laravel.io/topic/46/podcast-4-laracon-lean-and-war-stories) [Shawn McCool](https://twitter.com/ShawnMcCool), [Taylor Otwell](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell) and [Matthew Machuga](https://twitter.com/machuga) discuss the upcoming Laravel conference in Amsterdam, code-base complexity and tell stories from their development past.

### Practical Tutorial Series By Dayle Rees

[Dayle Rees](https://twitter.com/daylerees), one of the Laravel core team members, recently started a new practical tutorial series on various development subjects. He already posted two series. One about [Dependency Injection](https://github.com/daylerees/dependency-injection-example) and another about [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](https://github.com/daylerees/test-driven-development-example).

### 50% Off Laravel Testing Decoded

Because of Laracon EU, [Jeffrey](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way) is giving a 50% discount on his book ["Laravel Testing Decoded"](https://leanpub.com/laravel-testing-decoded) for this week only. You can use the coupon code "yay-laracon" to get the discount.

### News From PHP-FIG

[Phil Sturgeon recently announced](https://twitter.com/philsturgeon/status/372425522082750464) that the PHP-FIG has been making quite some progress on the next PSR standards. The [PSR-4 Autoloading standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/tree/master/proposed/psr-4-autoloader) has been moved to review. The PSR-4 standard will allow composer packages to have a much cleaner directory structure and is a welcome addition to the PSR-0 standard. The [PSR-5 PHPDoc standard](https://github.com/phpDocumentor/fig-standards/tree/master/proposed) has passed it entrance vote and is currently still actively being worked on. I'm personally very exited about this as we'll finally be getting some clear guidelines on how to structure our API documentation.

### WithLaravel Job Board

[SANIsoft](http://www.sanisoft.com/), one of the sponsors for Laracon EU, recently released a job board called [WithLaravel](http://withlaravel.com/) specifically targeting Laravel developers. You can post jobs for which you're looking for developers or you could list yourself as a developer, available for work.
