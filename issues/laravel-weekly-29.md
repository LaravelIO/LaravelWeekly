# Laravel Weekly #29

Welcome to issue #29! While we reported last week that we passed the 600 subscriber milestone we can happily report that just in one week we passed the 700 subscriber milestone as well! 721 people will be reading this issue. Again, thanks for all of your support!

In this issue we've added a separate section for Laracasts in the resources section. Laracasts gets updated weekly with great screencasts so from now on we'll provide you a list with new screencasts which were published in the past week. We'll mark the free issues after the link.

See you next week!
