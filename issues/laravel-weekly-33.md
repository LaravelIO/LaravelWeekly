# Laravel Weekly #33

Small update this week. Since I'm running short on content since the latest few issues I'd like to stress again that anyone can send me their articles, packages, projects you're working on etc to be featured in this newsletter. As long as it's Laravel related of course. Send everything to [hello@laravelweekly.com](mailto:hello@laravelweekly.com)!

Also, if you paste a lot of stickers on your MacBook, you might want to save some room for [these](http://dribbble.com/shots/1337788-Branding-Laracon-Stickers) ;-)

Thanks for reading and see you next week!


## News

### Laravel France

Bonjour! [The French Laravel website](http://laravel.fr/), which was created by [Julien Tant](https://twitter.com/AoSiX), has been updated with a fresh look. The new version also features [a wiki](http://wiki.laravel.fr/welcome) to which you can contribute.


### Glottos - An Online Translation/Localization System

The package I'd like to feature this week is [Glottos](https://github.com/antonioribeiro/glottos), built by [Antonio Carlos Ribeiro](https://github.com/antonioribeiro). Glottos is a translation and localization system, meaning it provides support for extending your application with multilingual capabilities. While the package provides support for Laravel out of the box, it's been built to be as framework agnostic as possible.

If you'd like to see an example implementation, Antonio has built [Glottos Admin](https://github.com/antonioribeiro/glottosAdmin) for you to check out.
