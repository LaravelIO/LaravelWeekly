# Laravel Weekly #38

Small update this week. I've been rather busy over the past couple of weeks so I missed a few links and resources in last week's issue, sorry about that! I'd also like to thank everyone who has contributed to this newsletter so far. You've all been a great help!

Ow and by the way: I'll be at [PHPBenelux 2014](http://conference.phpbenelux.eu/2014/) this friday and saturday. [Hit me up at twitter](https://twitter.com/driesvints) if you want to hang out!

Thanks for reading!

## News

### Protobox

[Protobox](http://getprotobox.com/) allows you to select modules for provisioning your virtual machine. The website generates a YAML file that protobox uses when provisioning a new virtual machine with vagrant.

Check out the full list of modules right [here](https://github.com/protobox/protobox#modules). The website itself is also built on Laravel. You can check out its source code over [here](https://github.com/protobox/protobox-web).

### Geocodio

[Geocodio](http://geocod.io/) is a RESTful API service that turns any US street address into map coordinates. You can geocode any US address with 90%+ accuracy (defined as results within 1 mile).

The service starts at 2500 free geocodes a day and after that, paid geocodes for $.001 each which is ridiculous cheap! Did I already mention the project's built on Laravel?
