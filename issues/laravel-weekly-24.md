# Laravel Weekly #24

It's been a crazy week with lots of new articles for you to read and learn from. We hope you'll enjoy this week's content.

In other news, the new laravel.io website is coming along nicely. Shawn has been working on it like crazy and already did a tremendous amount of work. We'll keep you posted with updates on the progress. In the meantime check out the post below to see how you can participate.

Thanks for reading!

## News

### Laravel IO 2.0

Some of you might have noticed already but [we've started working hard](https://github.com/LaravelIO/laravel-io) on the new laravel.io website. [There's still a lot to be done](https://github.com/LaravelIO/laravel-io/issues/16) before it's finished and we could really use the community's input in [the open issues](https://github.com/LaravelIO/laravel-io/issues?milestone=1&state=open) which are left. [Come join the discussion](https://github.com/LaravelIO/laravel-io/issues/16) and tell us what you'd like to see in the new community portal.

### Laravel IO Podcast #5

I forgot to include it in the last newsletter but the latest laravel.io podcast is out. [In episode #5](http://laravel.io/topic/49/podcast-5-with-matthew-machuga-and-chris-fidao) Shawn talks to Matthew Machuga and Chris Fidao.

### Laravel 4 Deployment

It's only been a little over a week but [Christopher Pitt](https://twitter.com/followchrisp) has already written a third extensive Laravel article on Medium. This time he talks about [deployment processes for Laravel 4](https://medium.com/on-coding/3bed5d0e645e).

## Quick Tip
