# Laravel Weekly #14

While development on Laravel 4.1 continues, more and more packages for Laravel 4 get released each week. Especially Maxime's [Rocketeer](http://anahkiasen.github.io/rocketeer/) package for deploying your app is one of the eye-catchers of the week.

[Peers conference](http://peersconf.com/2013/) is happening this week and Taylor will be doing a workshop and talk. If you are attending, make sure to catch those. I'm not sure if they're going record the sessions but I'll try to link to them should they get released.

Thanks for reading!
